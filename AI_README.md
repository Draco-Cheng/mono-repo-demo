# AI_README: Project Index & Conventions

This file is intended as a machine-readable and human-friendly index for AI assistants (such as GPT) and future contributors.  
It describes the overall architecture, conventions, and best practices for this monorepo.

---

## Monorepo Overview

- **Monorepo manager:** Nx
- **Languages:** TypeScript (frontend), Python (backend)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ (App Router, Atomic Design, CSS Modules)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- **Component Architecture:** Atomic Design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- **API Convention:** All backend endpoints are prefixed with `/api`
- **Scripts:** Cross-language scripts in `/scripts`
- **Nx targets:** All build/serve/test tasks are managed via Nx and/or scripts

## General Conventions

- **Naming:** Use lowerCamelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes, kebab-case for folders/files.
- **Atomic Design:** All UI components are organized by atomic level under `src/components/`.
- **Application-level logic:** Place in `templates/`, `pages/`, or directly in `app/` (Next.js).
- **Config:** Use language-native config files, but keep API prefixes and shared constants in a single place per language.
- **TypeScript:** Use strict typing, prefer interfaces for props and API responses.
- **Python:** Use type hints, keep config in `config.py` or `pyproject.toml`.

## AI Usage

- When using GPT or other AI tools, reference this file and the per-app AI_README files for context.
- Always follow the conventions and structure described here unless there is a strong reason to deviate.
